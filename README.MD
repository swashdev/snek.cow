## Installation

To add snek to your `cowsay` program, copy [`snek.cow`](snek.cow) into your
`COWPATH`.  Typically this will be `/usr/share/cowsay/cows`.  Use `cowsay -l`
to see what directories are in `COWPATH`.

The snek's eyes can be customized in the usual way (see `man cowsay` to learn
how), but its tongue can not.
